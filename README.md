Hello Gamers!

Find the stats of the person that just killed you in Fortnite.

Before you get started:

You will need to create an account and get an API KEY from https://dashboard.fortniteapi.io/



To get started:
1. Navigate to the main directory
2. `npm start`

While the killer's username is still onscreen during a battle royale match, press "Ctrl+Shift+K".
Note: I am still working on other types of kill cams.

You also can search via Epic Account Name in the user name input:

Reasons you may not yield results:
1. The username entered belongs to a restricted account.
2. The username entered is a PSN/XBOX/Switch name, not Epic.
